# How accurate is the fully connected network vs the convnet when they use similar number of operations?
# Why are you seeing these results? Speculate based on the information you've gathered and what you know about DL and ML.
# Your answer:
# ConvNets training accuracy: 0.699
# ConvNets test accuracy:     0.647
# Given the same number of operations, ConvNets are expected to be better since the 
# given number of limited computations are used to compute local features whereas a 
# fully connected network approximates a function that attempts to relate pixels from 
# entirely different sections of the image. Since images we are concerned have a structure
# local features are stronger indication and lead to better results.
